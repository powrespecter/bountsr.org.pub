The idea is that a user should be able tell their client to sort notes by proof of work (as defined in nip13), either as a toggle in the settings or as part of the main interface (if the client wants to make it easy to switch back and forth between different sortings).  It should be possible to sort all note feeds:

 - "Home", with some kind of specific time window (e.g. "notes from the past day sorted by pow")
 - "Replies", can be just a straight sort by pow
 - "Global", can include some time window like "Home" and maybe some friends-of-friends type filter too

This bounty applies to the major open source clients I'm familiar with:

 - Gossip
 - Amethyst
 - Damus
 - Snort
 - Iris
 - Coracle
 - Primal

For other clients please ask first, or suggest adding here with a PR.

The bounty doesn't have to be claimed by the app maintainer, it can be claimed by whoever implemented the feature.

This bounty is just for one client, will edit if I decide to pledge for additional clients.
